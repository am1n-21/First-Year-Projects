-- This repository is for projects that I have made as a first year software engineering student! --

-- Project 1: shwannybot --
This is my first project involving Python, Discord API, and SQLite3 Databases. It serves as a basic discord bot with basic features such as purging channels, but also involves databases by creating a vc time tracker for users in the server. Never packaged and uploaded to cloud.

-- Project 2: Tic Tac Toe --
This project involved the use of the NumPy library to create a board, and using humand and computer logic to create a match. There are two versions in the file, the first being a basic terminal game where the computer choices are randomized. The second version involves a min-max model where the computer learns, and it is displayed as a GUI.
