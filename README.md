-- Project 1: shwannybot --
This is my first project involving Python, Discord API, and SQLite3 Databases. It serves as a basic discord bot with basic features such as purging channels, but also involves databases by creating a vc time tracker for users in the server. Never packaged and uploaded to cloud.
